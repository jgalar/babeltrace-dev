@brief Common Trace Format Intermediate Representation.

The <em>Common Trace Format Intermediate Representation</em>,
or <strong><em>CTF IR</em></strong>, is the representation of the
<a href="http://diamon.org/ctf">CTF</a> model within Babeltrace.

As with any Babeltrace object, all the CTF IR objects have
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_counting">reference
counts</a>. See \ref refs to learn more about the reference counting
management of Babeltrace objects.

When the documentation says that a given
\link ctfirfieldtypes CTF IR field type\endlink must be
<em>equivalent to</em> another one, it means that
bt_ctf_field_type_compare() \em must return 0.
